		<h1>Attican</h1>

		<p>My name is Attican. It's what I always use for games or social media. I have a twin sister called Samalamadingdong, or otherwise Smomol, and we were born in Taiwan. My brother is called Anderson who is 20 years old, but he was born here, in Canada. I also have a dog named Tyson, who is a mix of German shepherd and Golden retriever. He was a stray dog found in the mountains in Taiwan, and my dad brought him over.</p>

		<p>I play the violin and the piano. Personally, I find the piano easier to play, but I've always played the violin. I have level 10 violin and level 6 piano, and I kind of want to get piano level 8 but I don't have enough time. I actually live in Richmond, and I was going to go to a high school there that was going to be mostly in French because I went to French Immersion. If I went there, I would have gotten an English and French diploma when I graduated.</p>
